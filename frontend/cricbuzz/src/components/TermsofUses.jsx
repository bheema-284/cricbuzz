            should seek refund from the financial service provider. If you are
            on a non auto renew subscription and wish to not continue with the
            paid service then after the plan term ends you may not make the next
            payment. If you are on an auto renew subscription, you can cancel
            auto renew of your subscription at any time, and you will continue
            to have access to the service through the end of your billing
            period. To cancel, go to the "My Account Manage Subscription" page
            and follow the instructions for cancellation. If you cancel your
