          <h4>Cookies</h4>
          <p>
            To improve the responsiveness for our users, we may use "cookies",
            or similar electronic tools to collect information to assign each
            user a unique, random number as a user Identification (user ID) to

            are, even if we assign a cookie to your computer. The only Personal
            Information a cookie can contain is information you supply. A cookie
            cannot read data off your hard drive. Our advertisers may also
            assign their own cookies to your browser (if you click on their
            ads), a process that we do not control. We receive and store certain
            types of information whenever you interact with us via Website,

            mobile/tablet/pad/handheld device etc.

          <h4>Accessing and Updating Personal Information</h4>

            themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected
            or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to
            process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic,
            require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of
            others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests
            concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which
            access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide
            information access and correction, we perform this service free of
            charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.
            Because of the way we maintain certain services, after you delete
            your information, residual copies may take a period of time before
            they are deleted from our active servers and may remain in our

            destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data
            collection, storage and processing practices and security measures,
            including appropriate encryption and physical security measures to
            guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal
            data.
          </p>
          <p>
            All information gathered on Cricbuzz is securely stored within the

            secured behind a firewall; access to the servers is
            password-protected and is strictly limited. However, as effective as
            our security measures are, no security system is impenetrable. We
            cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee
            that information you supply will not be intercepted while being
            transmitted to us over the internet. And, of course, any information
            you include in a posting to the discussion areas is available to
            anyone with internet access.
          </p>

            However the internet is an ever evolving medium. We may change our
            Privacy Policy from time to time to incorporate necessary future
            changes. Of course, our use of any information we gather will always
            be consistent with the policy under which the information was
            collected, regardless of what the new policy may be.
